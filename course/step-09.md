# Step 09: Agent-Assisted Integration

Use bounded agent assistance and persistent repository context to integrate remote services, browser capabilities, and a first application agent without surrendering review or control.

## Outcomes

- Scope and verify an agent-mode feature from issue through tested diff.
- Improve AI-assisted development with persistent repository instructions.
- Integrate a remote API behind an application model.
- Implement JavaScript interoperability in both directions.
- Explain the Microsoft Agent Framework landscape and its alternatives.
- Run a first agent in C# inside the application.

## Study Items

### General AI

1. [ ] Build a bounded feature with agent mode by defining an issue, completion criteria, command boundaries, diff review, and verification checks ([Agent-First Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu4sf8z9n8c), [Build an App with Agent Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmfldW7dmgw), [Copilot cloud-agent best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/cloud-agent/get-the-best-results), [Review Copilot output](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/use-copilot-agents/review-copilot-output))
2. [ ] Add persistent repository context for architecture, conventions, commands, safety, and completion, author it as `AGENTS.md` so multiple coding tools share one instruction source, then compare agent work with and without it using the same task and checks ([Context Engineering with Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jEzUhU8bLc), [VS Code custom instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/custom-instructions), [Repository custom instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions), [Evaluation best practices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/evaluation-best-practices))
3. [ ] Classify three kinds of workplace content as public, internal, or restricted against the AI tools used in this course, then draft a short team policy covering what may be shared with each tool, disclosure of AI-generated code, license and attribution review, and who is accountable when AI-assisted changes ship ([AI Security in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agents/run/security), [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot), [OpenAI usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/))
4. [ ] (Optional) Drive one small feature spec-first by writing a spec, then a plan, then a task breakdown, and implementing against them, then compare the outcome quality with the issue-first agent workflow of this step using the same checks ([VS Code: Plan work](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agents/run/planning), [Evaluation best practices](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/evaluation-best-practices))
5. [ ] (Optional) Explain when git worktrees let multiple coding agents work the same repository safely, run one agent-assisted change in a dedicated worktree, and record the merge-back and cleanup steps ([git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree), [VS Code: Agent best practices](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agents/best-practices))

### ASP.NET Core

1. [ ] Build a typed remote API client, distinguish transient from permanent failures, apply current resilience handlers, and map transport objects into application models ([Book: Chapter 33](https://livebook.manning.com/book/asp-net-core-in-action-third-edition/chapter-33), [`IHttpClientFactory`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory), [HTTP resilience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience), [Mapperly Documentation](https://mapperly.riok.app/))

### Blazor

1. [ ] Expose a safe .NET method to JavaScript and dispose object references at the correct lifetime boundary ([Calling .NET from JavaScript](https://blazor-university.com/javascript-interop/calling-dotnet-from-javascript), [Call .NET methods from JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-dotnet-from-javascript?view=aspnetcore-10.0))
2. [ ] Invoke browser APIs from .NET and handle `JSException` and disconnected-circuit failures ([Calling JavaScript from .NET](https://blazor-university.com/javascript-interop/calling-javascript-from-dotnet), [Call JavaScript from .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/javascript-interoperability/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-10.0), [Disconnected-circuit guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/javascript-interoperability/?view=aspnetcore-10.0))

### .NET AI

1. [ ] Explain the Microsoft Agent Framework landscape and when to choose it over the legacy Semantic Kernel or direct Microsoft Extensions AI use ([Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RNF9GsB8PU), [Agent Framework vs Semantic Kernel vs Extensions.AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ue9SmEtG9k), [GA Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZwxQmT1l7s), [Current Agent Framework overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/?pivots=programming-language-csharp))
2. [ ] Create and run a first agent in C# against the configured provider and compare provider options ([Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHy0-sXlmUY), [Zero to First OpenAI Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvA69UyqJ7U), [Using other LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbyEQWwBMFk), [Current C# quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/get-started/))
3. [ ] (Optional) Generate embeddings for application content with `IEmbeddingGenerator`, retrieve the most relevant chunks for a query, and implement grounded generation that answers only from retrieved context with cited sources ([Use the `IEmbeddingGenerator` interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/iembeddinggenerator), [Build a .NET AI vector search app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/vector-stores/how-to/build-vector-search-app))

## Tasks

### Task 1: Establish the Agent Development Contract

**Goal:** Make agent-assisted changes bounded, repeatable, and reviewable.

**Deliverable:** Persistent repository instructions, a bounded feature issue, agent plan, command log, reviewed diff, and verification results.

**Requirements:**

- Document architecture, conventions, build and test commands, safety rules, and definition of done.
- Run a small comparison with and without repository context.
- Reject or revise at least one unsuitable suggestion when present, or explain why all suggestions were acceptable.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] The issue states scope, exclusions, and objective completion checks.
- [ ] Repository instructions contain no secrets or machine-specific credentials.
- [ ] The final diff contains only intended changes and passes its checks.
- [ ] The comparison identifies the observable effect of persistent context.

### Task 2: Build the Integration Feature

**Goal:** Combine external data, AI processing, and a browser capability through explicit boundaries.

**Deliverable:** Typed remote client, mapping layer, Microsoft Extensions AI service, and a Blazor interaction that demonstrates both JavaScript-to-.NET and .NET-to-JavaScript calls.

**Requirements:**

- Map remote DTOs into internal models without leaking transport concerns into the UI.
- Handle timeout, invalid response, and unavailable-provider cases.
- Add one justified AI transformation or analysis of external data.
- Use JavaScript interop for a browser-only capability such as clipboard, focus, storage, or download.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Remote failures produce controlled application behavior.
- [ ] Product code depends on application abstractions rather than provider SDK types.
- [ ] JavaScript references are released where required and errors are handled.
- [ ] AI output is evaluated against at least three representative cases.

### Task 3: Run the First Product Agent

**Goal:** Bring a first Agent Framework agent into the application behind the existing service boundaries.

**Deliverable:** Agent service, framework decision note, provider configuration, recorded conversations, and fallback behavior.

**Requirements:**

- Register the agent behind an application abstraction so product code does not depend on agent SDK types.
- Record a short decision note explaining why Agent Framework fits this feature compared with alternatives.
- Keep the agent bounded to one clear product purpose.
- Handle the unavailable-provider case with controlled behavior.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] The agent completes its bounded purpose in at least three recorded conversations.
- [ ] Provider credentials stay outside source control.
- [ ] The decision note compares at least two alternatives with a stated reason.
- [ ] Provider failure produces a safe, documented response.
